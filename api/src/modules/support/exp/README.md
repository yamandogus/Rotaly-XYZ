# Support Interface Example

This is a comprehensive React-based support interface example for the Rotaly XYZ project. It demonstrates how to integrate with the backend support module APIs.

## Features

### Customer Interface

- **Ticket Management**: Create, view, and manage support tickets
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Interactive AI-powered support chat with automatic ticket escalation
- **Category-based Support**: Different ticket categories (Technical, Billing, etc.)
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Track ticket status and responses

### Admin Interface

- **Dashboard**: Overview of support statistics and representative workload
- **Representative Management**: View support rep performance and ticket distribution
- **Analytics**: Support metrics and trends

### Components

#### Core Components

- `CreateTicketForm`: Form for creating new support tickets
- `TicketList`: Display and filter support tickets
- `AIChatInterface`: Interactive AI chat with auto-escalation
- `AdminDashboard`: Admin statistics and management interface

#### Common Components

- `Button`: Reusable button component with variants
- `Input/TextArea/Select`: Form input components
- `Badge`: Status and category indicators

### API Integration

The interface integrates with the backend support module through:

- `POST /api/support` - Create support ticket
- `GET /api/support` - List support tickets with filtering
- `GET /api/support/:id` - Get ticket details
- `PATCH /api/support/:id/close` - Close ticket
- `POST /api/support/ai-chat` - AI chat interaction
- `GET /api/support/ai-status` - Check AI availability
- `GET /api/support/statistics/reps` - Admin statistics

### Support Categories

- **TECHNICAL**: Technical issues and bugs
- **BILLING**: Payment and billing inquiries
- **RESERVATION**: Hotel reservation problems
- **GENERAL**: General questions
- **COMPLAINT**: Customer complaints
- **FEATURE_REQUEST**: New feature suggestions
- **SECURITY**: Security-related concerns
- **OTHER**: Miscellaneous issues

### AI Features

The AI chat assistant can:

- Answer common questions
- Provide instant support
- Automatically create tickets when escalation is needed
- Categorize issues appropriately
- Suggest solutions based on conversation context

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Development

```bash
npm start
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Architecture

### State Management

- React hooks for local component state
- Props drilling for component communication
- Service layer for API calls

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom component classes
- Responsive design patterns

### Type Safety

- TypeScript for type checking
- Interface definitions for API responses
- Strict typing for props and state

## Integration with Backend

This interface is designed to work with the existing support module in the API:

```
api/src/modules/support/
├── controller.ts       # API endpoints
├── service.ts         # Business logic
├── repository.ts      # Database operations
└── route.ts          # Route definitions
```

### Authentication

The interface expects JWT authentication:

- Token stored in localStorage
- Automatic token inclusion in API requests
- Redirect to login on 401 responses

### Error Handling

- Network error handling
- Form validation
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states

## Customization

### Theming

- Modify `tailwind.config.js` for custom colors
- Update component classes in `index.css`
- Customize component variants

### Features

- Add new ticket categories
- Extend AI capabilities
- Add real-time notifications
- Implement file attachments

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Configuration

- Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to production API
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up proper authentication

### Hosting

- Can be hosted on any static hosting service
- Requires proxy configuration for API calls
- Compatible with Nginx, Apache, or CDN deployment

## Security Considerations

- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection through JWT authentication
- Input validation on both client and server
- Secure API communication over HTTPS

## Performance

- Component lazy loading
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo
- Pagination for large ticket lists
- Debounced search and filters

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ES6+ features required
- Mobile responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface

## Contributing

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Maintain component isolation
3. Add proper error handling
4. Include loading states
5. Write meaningful commit messages
